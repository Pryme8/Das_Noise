I cant seem to get Perlin2-3 to work right for right now... Ill end up reworking them later.<br />
<br />
The Script is redudent and I will clean it up and make correct constructors all wrapped under a single object here soon.
You must have a way to pass vectors to the function, so some other library or custom definitions.<br />
<br />
Once I finish up some more, it wont matter if you pass a vector of floats but for right now I wanted vectors.  Examples coming soon.
Look in the JS folder for the scripts.
