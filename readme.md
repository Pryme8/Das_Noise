http://Pryme8.github.io/Das_Noise for examples.
WIP EDITOR => http://Pryme8.github.io/Das_Noise/editor.html

Ill put some documentation up at some point... but I figured this is simple enought to figure out from the examples.
Some of the calculations really need to be improved.

Coming Soon:
- Import/Export
- More Filters
- Animations
- Better/Alternitive Wurley
- 3d Editor
- More noises ported from GLSL
- Experemental Noises of my own creation.
- More modes of distance.

Free to use, but please at least post some credits to =>
